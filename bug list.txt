#NOT done with these:


  Make md2pdf a one-step process

  Can the dictionary be easily sorted into alphabetical order?

        Currently the final output pdf gets cut off when prining (top and bottom)... I can solve this by having it "scale to fit" when I print, but it'd be easier if the output document didn't get cut off.

        I've changed the margins, but you should feel free to monkey with them. Look at lines 33-45 in templates/visit/NDCHart.cls



#Not gonna do this
  LF says:
    Images (sometimes) overlap with side boxes
  AS says:
    make the images smaller, or break into several image tags or put the images elsewhere. This is hard to make 'just work'.
