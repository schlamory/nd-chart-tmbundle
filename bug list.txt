#NOT done with these:

When it makes a new patient folder, it makes the folder Firstname Lastname, but I would like it to make it Lastname, Firstname so it will be sorted alphabetically in the finder.

#DONE WITH THESE!

  Dictionary not quite working right.  When I try to define a new entry ie:Overweight 278.02 icd[tab] it returns: Overweight 278.02 (unk) and does not define anything new in the dictionary.
  
  Make "patient[tab]" insert the patient's full name ie: Amory Schlender

  Make "age[tab]" insert the patent's age ie: 30

  NEW BUG!!!! I couldn't get the new preview command to work.  Got the following error:
    "/Users/laurafigoski/Library/Application Support/Avian/Bundles/ND Chart.tmbundle/bin/nd/visit.rb:169:in `rescue in initialize_from_dir':  (RuntimeError)

    The working directory (/Users/laurafigoski/Desktop/Charts/Gilbert, Fiona/visits/2014_03_28) is not a patient visit directory. Please try again from a patient visit directory.

    from /Users/laurafigoski/Library/Application Support/Avian/Bundles/ND Chart.tmbundle/bin/nd/visit.rb:162:in `initialize_from_dir'
    from Preview Progress Note:4:in `<main>'"

  Make md2pdf a one-step process - and ultimatley have the final visit pdf live in main pt directly, rather than being burried in the visits/2014_04_04/tex/... directory.  Have final pdf file name begin with date of visit (ie: 2014_04_04 progress note.pdf)

  Can the dictionary be easily sorted into alphabetical order?

  Add support for "gender" to be added to patient.yml and have it render in the header with other pt info.

  Alerts don't render

  Make Dr. Laura Figoski, ND, phone and email in the header 1-2 font sizes bigger

  LF says:
        Currently the final output pdf gets cut off when prining (top and bottom)... I can solve this by having it "scale to fit" when I print, but it'd be easier if the output document didn't get cut off.
  AS says:
        I've changed the margins, but you should feel free to monkey with them. Look at lines 33-45 in templates/visit/NDCHart.cls



#Not gonna do this
  LF says:
    Images (sometimes) overlap with side boxes
  AS says:
    make the images smaller, or break into several image tags or put the images elsewhere.
