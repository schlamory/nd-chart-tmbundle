ICD-9 dictionary

I want:
- abdominal pain icd 
to turn into:
- abdominal pain (666)
Right now, it seems to choke on multi-word diagnoses.

I want to override old definitions when I put in new ones, e.g. when I do
  abdominal pain icd 666
and then
  abdominal pain icd 777
I want 
  abdominal pain icd
to turn into 
  abdominal pain (777)

side box list environment stretches when it wraps, and looks bad, e.g.:
| * Tobacco     use    (305.1)|
|   [smokeless]               | 
Should be:
| * Tobacco use (305.1)       |
|   [smokeless]               | 

Horizontal rule (line) doesn't span the page. It should. 

Remove section numbers. Make section title smaller size, but still bold.

In final pdf, make the lists in the side boxes single spaced, make all the lists in the body, single spaced.

When I make a follow up visit, copy the past exisiting visit so that I can use the previous visit as a template for the current visit.  

Images don't render.

Fix indentation (\noindent?) of text and lists in body.  I want it to look like this:

    Reason for visit: Fatigue

    Stress: 
      - lots of stress
      - lots of worry
      - anxious

    Energy:
      - low
      - worst in first thing in morning
      - best at 10am

Not like this:


    Reason for visit: Fatigue

        Stress: 
        - lots of stress
        - lots of worry
        - anxious

        Energy:
        - low
        - worst in first thing in morning
        - best at 10am


Add footer.  Copy example style.

Create a snippet that allows me to insert the problem list into assessment.
