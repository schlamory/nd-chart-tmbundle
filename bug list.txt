ICD-9 dictionary

I want:
- abdominal pain icd 
to turn into:
- abdominal pain (666)
Right now, it seems to choke on two-word diagnoses.

I want to override old definitions when I put in new ones, e.g. when I do
  abdominal pain icd 666
and then
  abdominal pain icd 777
I want 
  abdominal pain icd
to turn into 
  abdominal pain (777)
