        ICD-9 dictionary

        I want:
        - abdominal pain icd
        to turn into:
        - abdominal pain (666)
        Right now, it seems to choke on multi-word diagnoses.

        I want to override old definitions when I put in new ones, e.g. when I do
          abdominal pain icd 666
        and then
          abdominal pain icd 777
        I want
          abdominal pain icd
        to turn into
          abdominal pain (777)

        side box list environment stretches when it wraps, and looks bad, e.g.:
        | * Tobacco     use    (305.1)|
        |   [smokeless]               |
        Should be:
        | * Tobacco use (305.1)       |
        |   [smokeless]               |

      In final pdf, make the lists in the side boxes single spaced, make all the lists in the body, single spaced.



      Remove section numbers. Make section title smaller size, but still bold.

      Horizontal rule (line) doesn't span the page. It should.

      Fix indentation (\noindent?) of text and lists in body.  I want it to look like this:

          Reason for visit: Fatigue

          Stress:
            - lots of stress
            - lots of worry
            - anxious

          Energy:
            - low
            - worst in first thing in morning
            - best at 10am

      Not like this:


          Reason for visit: Fatigue

              Stress:
              - lots of stress
              - lots of worry
              - anxious

              Energy:
              - low
              - worst in first thing in morning
              - best at 10am


      Add footer.  Copy example style.


      When I make a follow up visit, copy the past exisiting visit so that I can use the previous visit as a template for the current visit.

      Create a snippet that allows me to insert the problem list into assessment.

      Images don't render.
