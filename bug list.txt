#NOT done with these:

  Make md2pdf a one-step process - and ultimatley have the final visit pdf live in main pt directly, rather than being burried in the visits/2014_04_04/tex/... directory.  Have final pdf file name begin with date of visit (ie: 2014_04_04 progress note.pdf)

  Can the dictionary be easily sorted into alphabetical order?
  
  Make "patient[tab]" insert the patient's full name ie: Amory Schlender
  
  Make "age[tab]" insert the patent's age ie: 30
    
  Add support for "gender" to be added to patient.yml and have it render in the header with other pt info.
  
  NEW BUG!!!! I couldn't get the new preview command to work.  Got the following error:
    "/Users/laurafigoski/Library/Application Support/Avian/Bundles/ND Chart.tmbundle/bin/nd/visit.rb:169:in `rescue in initialize_from_dir':  (RuntimeError)

    The working directory (/Users/laurafigoski/Desktop/Charts/Gilbert, Fiona/visits/2014_03_28) is not a patient visit directory. Please try again from a patient visit directory.

    from /Users/laurafigoski/Library/Application Support/Avian/Bundles/ND Chart.tmbundle/bin/nd/visit.rb:162:in `initialize_from_dir'
    from Preview Progress Note:4:in `<main>'"

#DONE WITH THESE!

  Alerts don't render

  Make Dr. Laura Figoski, ND, phone and email in the header 1-2 font sizes bigger

  LF says:
        Currently the final output pdf gets cut off when prining (top and bottom)... I can solve this by having it "scale to fit" when I print, but it'd be easier if the output document didn't get cut off.
  AS says:
        I've changed the margins, but you should feel free to monkey with them. Look at lines 33-45 in templates/visit/NDCHart.cls



#Not gonna do this
  LF says:
    Images (sometimes) overlap with side boxes
  AS says:
    make the images smaller, or break into several image tags or put the images elsewhere.
